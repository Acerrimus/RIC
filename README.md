My own AI assistant project (yes, I know, very original)
This is just a temporary holding place for a project I started back in year 7/8, I will get back to this once I'm more familiar with ACTUAL ML, and not just hard coding responses. 
Feel free to check out the earliest version if you want to be amused and tortured at the same time
